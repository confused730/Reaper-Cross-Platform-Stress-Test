Project Created with:

Software: Reaper
Verison: v6.10
Created: 11th May 2020
Last Updated: -

// Purpose:

To Stress test system CPU by testing how many tracks it can run with each track running the following plugins:
- RealEQ (VST)
- ReaSynth (VSTi)
- Convolution Amp/Cab Modeler (JS)
- ReaComp (VST)
- ReaDelay (VST)
- ReaVerb (VST)

\\

// Notes: 

While this won't reflect real world usage, as this uses stock plugins exclusively. 
This makes this a very Cross platform friendly test stress test. 
Works on anything that Reaper works on, which is most operating systems, including OSx, Windows XP-10, 
and linux Distros such as Ubuntu and Rasbian. I await the day I can make p h a t Beats on my toaster. 

//Method:

1: Load up one of the projects 
 - pick the one that you think your computer can handle. You can always add more tracks later.

2: Ensure the project is on loop and press play. 

3: Enable the Track FX on the TCP one by one. 
 - be aware of volume at all times.

4: Duplicate tracks if you exceed the project.

5: Note as to when you:
 Parameter A) Begin to hear audio artifacts in playback
 Parameter B) Reaper stops working or stops playback
 - For Example, when if at 33 tracks it sounds fine but 34 it starts to crackle, 
your system can handle 33 tracks with the "A" parameter. 
Same Method with parameter B, but with reaper/ System Failure.
